    <h4>Surprising depth to the story</h4>
    <p>Just finished True Beauty tonight (it's the first full show I've got through in a 
        while without being distracted by other shows ðŸ˜Š) and I absolutely loved it.
         So happy with how it turned out. It's definitely going on my faves list
          and will no doubt be rewatched sometime.</p>

        <h4>Emotional, sweet and funny</h4>
        <p>This is one of those shows where the secondary characters shine so much
             you forget about the story of the main leads. This drama has a nice backstory
              and although it's quite typical and it has been repeated a lot in other dramas
               and movies, keeps you interested. I loved the funny moments and the most 
               appealing thing for me was the story and relationship of the two brothers
                as well as the backstories of all the supporting cast, moving, deep and 
                painful but very beautiful. Also, what an amazing, refreshing and shocking
                 twist at the end! Didn't expect it and I loved it!!! Well done to the writers!</p>

                <h4>Unexpectedly Fantastic Story of Revenge</h4>
                <p>I had to add my review after I read a few awfully negative reviews of #ItaewonClass 
                    I decided to watch this show because I liked PSJ in What is a Wrong With Secretary Kim 
                    and I'm thrilled I did!! He was awesome in this series! He is a great actor! I loved the
                     themes on this series, and most of all, the gutsy performance of Kim Da Mi. 
                     Her Yi-Seo is epic. She shines!! Finally! A woman who saves the day!!!! 
                     This is a great show! Watch it! And don't get distracted by those who think otherwise!!!</p>
